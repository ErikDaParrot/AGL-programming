# AGL
A golfing programming language derived from GolfScript and many array programming languages, combined to fit on the typable keyboard. 

**Status: still a bit unstable!!!**

Examples:
```
#{1+'**}%'\ns*p!       ==> creates a star triangle
va.sLvd++:{:?}-2/' s*  ==> blur the text code-golf problem¹
```

# Running
Just download the source code and python (if not already installed), and then run *main.py* from the command line.
```
Arguments:
python3 main.py <file-name> ==> run file
```
More features will be added later!

# Documentation
Documentation is still in progress as the language is still evolving. For now, refer to *parse.py* for the definitions of the functions.  
Stay tuned for future updates!

**Note: For future updates there will be a Comparisons page to refer to as a dictionary between programming languages.**
